Public part:
* Page which lists all registered motorbikes.
* Page with detailed information about one selected motorbike.
* Add pagination to the list, showing a maximum of 5 bikes per page.
* Add sorting, it should be possible to sort by price and by date (date the bike was added)
* Add filtering (for example by color)
